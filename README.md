# Coins-experiment
This project simulates guessing the color of a coin with an unknown other side. Three types of coins are considered: red-red (RR), white-white (WW), and red-white (RW). The goal is to analyze the probabilities of correctly guessing the color and observe changes as the number of guesses increases.
